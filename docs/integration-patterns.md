# Integration Patterns

- Claude / Anthropic: Use the markdown workflows in `.claude/commands/*` as system prompts or commands.
- MCP (Model Context Protocol): Orchestrate tools and data sources; map workflows to MCP tasks.
- LangChain / CrewAI: Wrap agent roles as chains/crews and map budgets to step limits.
- IDE: Surface budgets, auctions, and anti-pattern alerts inline (planned VS Code extension).
- Telemetry (planned): Capture opt-in, anonymized metrics for evaluation.
