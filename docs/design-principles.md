# Workflow Design Principles

- Game-theoretic constraints prevent cognitive traps (analysis paralysis, bikeshedding, over-engineering).
- Energy and attention budgets create scarcity to force prioritization.
- Auctions and markets allocate scarce review time efficiently.
- Multi-agent specialization reduces tunnel vision; adjudication resolves disagreements.
- Quality gates and sequential processing maintain forward momentum.
- Familiarity preservation avoids unnecessary churn.
